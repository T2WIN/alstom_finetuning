The stator consists of the two magnetic poles, bearing the excitation windings and being mounted in a frame assembly that also serves as a return conduit for the magnetic flux (back, yoke). Pole shoes conduct this magnetic flux into the rotor, or anchor, resulting in an air gap beneath the poles of a constant width of just a few millimetres. Nowadays, poles, pole shoes and yoke are always laminated, similar to transformers, to ensure the flux follows the exciter-current value (or, in the case of series-wound motors, the armature current respectively).\nThe distance of two poles on the circumference is called pole pitch ( \u03c4 p ), whereas the area of the circumference between the two poles is the neutral zone ."}

Alternative permanent measures include the use of continuously welded rail technology which eliminates the discontinuity associated with rail joints.  This approach is becoming widespread, particularly on high speed lines.  Another permanent approach is to insert highly damped pads between track components [102].  For example rail pads can be inserted between rail and sleepers to reduce the vibration and stresses between components.  Sleeper pads act in a similar manner, but are placed between sleepers and ballast.  Both rail and sleeper pads act to dampen high frequency vibration and shift the spectrum to a lower range.  This helps to reduce the overall track vibration levels, however these low frequency vibrations are more likely to resonate with structure/buildings close to the track.

But they were outmoded by the fast development of the semiconductor devices towards asymmetric GTO-thyristor types and IGBTs optimized for VSI circuits, without reverse-blocking capability. The CSI needs this feature.\nSimilarly to the synchronous 'converter' motor, a roughly constant direct current impressed by a line converter (the storing element of the DC link is a reactor) is distributed by the inverter in form of 'block' currents cyclically to the three motor windings. As the induction motor needs to be magnetized always by the feeding supply (underexcited operation), it cannot commutate a thyristor bridge, like the overexcited synchronous machine. This has to be performed by capacitors between the winding terminals, which are protected by separation diodes against discharging. Firing the thyristor next in the phase sequence, the previous is turned off; from that the name Autosequential Current-Source Inverter (ASCI)."}

Mitigation strategies have then been synthesised from the literature -e.g. reduction in unsprung mass and active control; systems.\n- (2) It is well established that track vibrations are undesirable because they cause riding quality and safety concerns; and increase track degradation. A large volume of papers have been written on predicting track and ground borne vibrations using techniques ranging from classical mathematical analyses to finite element (FEM) and boundary element methods (BEM). The many analysis techniques have been summarised in tabular format drawing attention to 2-D, 2.5-D and 3-D analyses. An attempt has been made to present a clear and simplified set of guidelines for designers. An obvious conclusion is that the more complex 3D models are computationally hungry."}

The timetable provides the supply. In integrated periodic timetables , all trains arrive at stations (almost) at the same time, enabling multiple transfers before departing (almost at the same time), and this repeats periodically (e.g., all 30 min). This hub-and-spoke principle requires specific travel times between stations to operate effectively, and can result in more capacity requirements than other timetables. It has been used in Switzerland since many years, and most experts are in favour of keeping it because it enables the plannability of the trip and good transfers. However, it was also mentioned that its rigid structure has disadvantages. Reducing the strict periodicity allows for improvement in peak-hour services to manage greater demand. In the extreme case, a dynamic timetable is available to passengers shortly before operations (matter of hours), which brings the possibility of being responsive\nTABLE 5.

In 1825, the very first public transport railway was established between Stockton and Darlington in North-East England, George and Robert Stevenson introducing today's 4ft 8.5in standard gauge on this occasion. In 1835, the first such railway opened service in Germany, connecting Nuremberg and Fuerth.\nFrom isolated beginnings, European railwaying downright exploded in the following years; however, a bewildering variety of technical standards was used. By 1850, a necessary trend toward standardization of gauge, coupling system and general size of units emerged, leading to technical standards which allowed for a Europe-wide network of compatible standards. Some countries retained different gauges for strategic reasons, most notably Russia, but also including Spain and Portugal.

Although noise is also generated, it is contained within the tunnel and therefore vibrations are of primary concern for structures located above the line.

Although these solutions proved invaluable in the validation of many complex wave propagation models proposed thereafter, the adaption of such an analytical approach to include a moving train/track model that is representative of a railway system, is challenging.  The first steps towards achieving this were undertaken by [114, 48, 115, 49, 116-122] who built upon Lamb ' s work to facilitate moving load simulation.  Further modifications were proposed by [107-113] to tailor the approach to railways.  Despite this, to enable the train-track system to be modelled analytically, many assumptions must be made to reduce model complexity, particularly with respect to model geometry and excitation mechanism.  Although significant research into this area is still being pursued [142], these challenges mean that it has become more common to use numerical techniques as they are better suited to simulating the aforementioned complexities."}

The difference between these types of track models and the ones discussed in the ground modelling section later in this report, are that the track response is of interest, not the far field ground vibrations.  Therefore the soil model is included solely to increase the accuracy of the track model.  The most common approach to achieving this is to model the ground as a linear elastic half-space.  This approach was undertaken by [89] to study critical velocity effects.  A challenge of this approach is that computational time is increased and absorbing boundary conditions are needed to terminate the unbounded soil domain."}

There is also equipment for which specifications have not been specified. Therefore, under these circumstances it is necessary to calculate the headcount based on shift work of the work team. As a means of the calculation, prepare a roadmap for the maintenance works. Based on this roadmap, the number of personnel for the electric divisions at the OUs can be calculated.\n- -Take into account elements such as days-off, sickness, etc. of maintenance personnel."}

But the two single wheels of one side are driven commonly by one induction motor via hypoid bevel gears, which is mounted at the outside of the frame (Figs. 10.24, 10.25). After first orders in Basel/Switzerland, Potsdam/Germany and Amsterdam the Combino seemed to be well accepted by the market.\nBut with the beginning of the new century, cracks were detected in the roof girders of the aluminum carbody, which had to be attributed to an insufficient consideration of the cumulative load by the vertical thrusts, produced by the single-wheel running gear, in comparison with that of a true bogie. Severe reconstruction of all carbodies and parts of the joints was necessary, and several years no new trains were produced; now Combino Plus is under delivery. Similar damages were reported for steel-bodied vehicles of the MF6D type."}

To circumvent the problems of small, individually driven single wheels, at first the so-called '70 % low-floor tram' (centre line) with flat, but more or less conventional motor bogies under the high-floor end area was introduced, e.g. type M(N)F6D by D\u00dcWAG/ Siemens (first  application  in  Bochum  1992,  Figs.  10.15  and  10.16).  By  space-saving  induction  traction motors and cardan hollow-shaft drives with rubber joints (cf. Fig. 3.18) the floor height is only about 700 mm. By steps the low-floor portion with 350 mm height (of some 70% of train length) is reached; the entry is only 290 mm over rail top. Radially-steered single-wheel trailing running gear (EEF) supports the centre car, on which the end-cars lean by means of a pivot joint. The air-cooled GTO inverters are mounted on roof-top."}

They use a Delphi methodology, i.e., multiple rounds of interviews with experts from the sector, which also ranked innovations in terms of perceived effectiveness. The main aspects identified in this way pertain to perceived challenges regarding skills required and available from humans in a highly automated system.\nM\u00e4kitalo and Hilmola [25] propose a similar analysis focusing on freight transport, also using a Delphi approach to interview experts.
